# Start Here â€” Reset and upload new project

This file explains how the repository was reset and how to push your new project files to a fresh branch named `new-initial`.

Steps I performed:

1. Created a backup branch `backup-before-orphan` that contains the previous working content.
2. Prepared a new orphan branch `new-initial` that will contain only the new initial files.

To add your own project files to `new-initial` locally and push them to GitHub:

```bash
# Make sure you're on the orphan branch
git checkout new-initial

# Copy or create your project files here (do not overwrite .git)
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit on new-initial: fresh project"
git push -u origin new-initial
```

If `git push` reports "src refspec new-initial does not match any", it means there wasn't a local branch or a commit. Ensure you committed at least one file.

If you want to replace the `main` branch instead (destructive), let me know and I'll provide the exact force-push commands and take backups.
